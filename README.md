## üìñ Legacy Documentation Highlights

Since version 1.25 retains the core functionality of version 1.24 (except for PHP 7.4+ compatibility and bug fixes), here are some useful legacy features:

### **Installation (Legacy)**
- Unzip the package and upload it to your server.
- Ensure `config.php` has write permissions (`chmod 777`).
- Open `http://yourserver/MySQLDumper` to complete the setup.
- If safe mode is enabled, manually create necessary directories.

### **Perl Backup (Legacy)**
- Copy `crondump.pl`, `perltest.pl`, and `simpletest.pl` to the `cgi-bin` directory.
- Edit `crondump.pl` and configure `$absolute_path_of_configdir`.
- Set `chmod 755` permissions on these scripts.
- If needed, rename `.pl` files to `.cgi` and adjust settings.

### **Configuration Settings (Legacy)**
- **Table Prefix Filtering:** Dump only tables with a specific prefix.
- **GZip Compression:** Reduce backup file size.
- **Backup File Directory:** Define custom storage paths.
- **Batch Processing:** Adjust the number of records processed per cycle to avoid timeouts.

## üìä Development and Contributions
This is a community-driven project. If you encounter issues or have feature requests, feel free to open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/ulusanyazilim/MySQLDumper/pulls) or submit an issue.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices
- Store backup files in a **non-public** directory.
- Secure login credentials to prevent unauthorized access.
